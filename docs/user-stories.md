    - When the API finds the resource
    - Then the API responds with `200 OK` and returns the favorite source resource (`id`, `newsApiKey`, `sourceId`).
- Scenario: Not found
    - Given a request `GET /api/v1/favorite-sources/{id}` for a non-existent `{id}` is received
    - When the API does not find the resource
    - Then the API responds with `404 Not Found`.

### TS003 — Check whether a source is favorite for a NewsAPI key
As a frontend developer, I want to query the API with `{newsApiKey}` and `{sourceId}` so that I can implement the UI state that indicates whether a source is favorite.
#### Acceptance criteria:
- Scenario: Favorite exists
    - Given a request `GET /api/v1/favorite-sources?newsApiKey={newsApiKey}&sourceId={sourceId}` is received
    - When the API finds a matching favorite resource
    - Then the API responds with `200 OK` and returns the matching favorite resource.
- Scenario: Favorite does not exist
    - Given a request `GET /api/v1/favorite-sources?newsApiKey={newsApiKey}&sourceId={sourceId}` with no match is received
    - When the API does not find a matching resource
    - Then the API responds with `404 Not Found`.

### TS004 — Create a favorite source
As a frontend developer, I want to add a favorite source through the API so that I can implement the creation feature in my application.
#### Acceptance criteria:
- Scenario: Successful create
    - Given a request `POST /api/v1/favorite-sources` that includes required fields (`newsApiKey`, `sourceId`) is received
    - When the API validates and persists the new resource successfully
    - Then the API responds with `201 Created`, and returns the created resource representation (`id`, `newsApiKey`, `sourceId`).
- Scenario: Validation error
    - Given a request `POST /api/v1/favorite-sources` with missing required fields or invalid values is received
    - When the API validation fails
    - Then the API responds with `400 Bad Request` and a localized error message describing the validation failure.
- Scenario: Duplicate favorite
    - Given a request `POST /api/v1/favorite-sources` for a `newsApiKey` + `sourceId` combination that already exists is received
    - When the API detects the duplicate pair before persistence or during persistence confirmation
    - Then the API responds with `409 Conflict` and an explanatory error payload.
- Scenario: Unexpected server error
    - Given a request `POST /api/v1/favorite-sources` is received
    - When an unexpected error occurs during persistence
    - Then the API responds with `500 Internal Server Error` and a `ProblemDetails` payload.# CatchUp Platform REST API Technical Stories
